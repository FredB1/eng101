      "content": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout my years as a student I have written many papers so this is a cherished topic. Writing can take on different styles but in essence I like to think of it as the communication of ideas through text. Early on in my life I learned the basics of writing along with reading while in school. Even at that early age we practiced similar habits of mind including creativity, flexibility and metacognition. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History teaches us that writing was developed as a way to track transactions. We often write journals or blogs about what is happening in our daily life. However that may not be what’s most admired by us, we are more likely to enjoy a good story. Such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the first the earliest written texts. Fictional tales like this are amazing for developing the creativity of writers which is one of the reasons it is still known of today. When writing either factual accounts or completely fictional it is the communication of ideas that intrigues us the most.  <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of learning to write starts at a young age. As kids when we start school we are introduced to the alphabet so we can start reading and writing small words. While progressing through school we read and write much more. Some of my favorite authors to read are J.K.Rowling, James Patterson and Scott Galloway. Although these authors write about different topics or within different genres they have the ability to communicate ideas that are entertaining to the reader. This has taught me the importance of analogies and metaphors. These literary concepts keep readers engaged like they are watching a martial arts master practicing his craft. Just like any craft must continue practicing writing to learn how to connect with different audiences or as described in this course rhetorical knowledge.  <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My understanding of writing also includes the important habits of mind. Creativity within writing is very interesting. It allows the reader the opportunity to think about your ideas in a way that they have not heard before. Along with that flexibility allows us to write on a broad range of topics. This ranges from serious writing such as a sermon or biography to more creative and playful writing like romance novels and comic books. It will be important to be mindful of staying flexible as writers as we develop our rhetorical knowledge. As we develop our skills as writers metacognition becomes ever more important, the ability to think about what we have written in the past and improve upon those ideas for even greater clarity to the reader.  <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As expressed writing is a craft that you can practice but it will take a long time to master it. Even when you feel masterful there are more audiences to write for and styles of writing you can practice. My understanding of writing is that you can always continue to grow. Throughout this course we will continue to practice habits of mind so that we too can become better writers."

      "content": "   <p>In this journal I will discuss my first impressions of the Literacy Narrative. Planning our first major writing assignment feels like a big undertaking. This could be due to the lack of writing I have been doing. I know that writing consistently is the key to success in a course like this. However, since I stopped blogging I haven't had the motivation to work on my writing skills. When I do find the time to write it is much more convenient to write about my hobbies and interests. Therefore Literacy Narrative will be a lot more strict than my own personal creative writing.</p> <p>My first impressions of the writing narratives are that you can write about anything you've written in the past. That's very vague and there's endless possibilities since I have written a lot. I'm concerned that the vagueness will add to the complexity when trying to stay on topic. With  such a high word length it will be difficult not to ramble on about pointless topics. There will also be the need to make sure all topics are organized and flow consistently. I'm excited to share my experience with creative writing. Whether it be essays, term papers, book reports, or simple blog posts. I have written all of these things and they have helped shape me as a writer. </p> <p>Critical thinking and composing are the most important communication literacies in my life at the moment. Although we do live in a social media world I find myself writing more for professional purposes more often than personal. Ironically this is mostly chatting with my team members on slack or developing my professional network on LinkedIn. Slack and other team communication software has gotten even more important since the covid pandemic has started. The team I work with is full of remote workers and we need to be able to communicate to get our work done. Due to the nature of this type of communication it can be harder to communicate successfully this is why critical thinking and composing are so important. We need to ensure that work gets done efficiently while being as concise as possible. </p> <p>It may have helped if we had some type of formal training on communication in these platforms but there is no standard. Unfortunately while working independently through covid a lot of us found ourselves picking up new skills and moving into new fields. This is great for personal growth especially since we have to learn so much on our own.  For me I was just told “we’re using Slack to communicate”, it was just expected of me to know how to use it. I’m assuming it was the same for the rest of the team. I wish there was more formal communication training so everyone knew about how to transfer files or even better using GIt. Files become a huge mess especially when multiple people are working on the same file that becomes over a thousand lines long!</p> <p>I’m looking forward to writing the narrative assignment. It will be a great opportunity to share my experience with communication literacies. Until then I will be using my reading skills with Race after technology by Ruha benjamin. </p>"

      "content": "<p>Taking a walk down memory lane. In this journal we will look back at the past journals we have written. I am a firm believer that reflecting on the past can help you grow as a person. You may be able to identify errors in your own decision making that will help you make better decisions in the future. This applies perfectly to writing because we can look at our past work and improve upon what we have written so far. </p> <p>At this point in the course we have written two journals so far. My initial approach to the assignments has been to read over the requirements listed in the tasks section and write at least one detailed paragraph for each point. These assignments have shaped my writing by allowing me to practice the habits of mind. I feel a sense of enhanced metacognition now that I have been writing more. Now when I sit down to write I no longer feel the anxiousness over the word count or even the confusion that comes with trying to write the next sentence. There’s a more peaceful flow that helps me get the assignments done. </p> <p>Being able to process my thoughts in a much more organized way will help me not only in this course but in life as well. I believe the openness and responsibility gives me the desire to become a better human being overall. The best thing about these assignments in my opinion is that they have structure. Just as in life there is a criteria of what needs to be accomplished and it’s up to us to figure out the best way to tackle these problems. As a computer scientist this is a significant skill since the main requirement of the job is problem solving. In this field we mostly focus on math, however I believe writing is just as powerful. In math we are given a problem and expected to solve it by finding a specific answer. Writing similarly to life, is not like that. We have a lot more freedom to express ourselves creatively, no two lives are the same just as with writing assignments.</p> <p>A big concern of mine is interpersonal communication, I believe that being a great writer will also make you a better communicator. The way that writing makes us structure our words and thoughts is an absolute benefit to us. Structure gives us the ability to clearly explain our points in a way that the person we are communicating with will understand. For instance someone that lacks the structure we develop by writing may have great ideas but people will not be able to digest them if they leave people confused when they express themselves. When we structure our thoughts we have a better understanding of what our audience needs to understand before we move on to more complex ideas. </p>        <p>These writings have been a great experience. My mind is being developed so that i can not only solve more complex problems but explain these concepts to others and hopefully bring them to the same level of understanding. I see this as much more than just a course for credit but a life skill that will continue to pay dividends. </p>"

      "content": "<p>Miscommunication can derail your plans, in this writing journal we will reflect on a situation where the wrong use of words caused unintended results. We will also explore how word choice can affect others. When we are communicating in this digital age we still have to be sure to be clear with what we are saying. Sending quick texts to family and friends is fun, however  we must still put effort into them to ensure we have communicated our thoughts clearly.</p><p>It’s thanksgiving day, in my family it’s tradition to eat at my mom’s house. My sister and I often communicate through text. This time we were talking about the dinner menu to make sure we all had our favorite food. I was picking up a few drinks at the store when she sent me a text saying, Do you want pie for dessert? Excitedly, I responded Yes! After all, who could resist pie on Thanksgiving? However I had made a fatal mistake that I would not realize until much later.At dinner we indeed had pie, apple pie with a beautiful lattice crust and pumpkin pie. Unfortunately I’m a fan of sweet potato pie. It tastes delicious to me so I really missed having it for dessert. </p><p>When I said yes we never agreed to a specific kind of pie. This was a miscommunication on my end, I never said I was expecting sweet potato pie. I assumed that everyone loved sweet potato pie as much as I do. However they had just gone apple picking so there was an abundance of apples, so they made apple pie. Pumpkin pie is also very traditional so it is no surprise that it was made for dessert. There was no way she would know that I wanted sweet potato pie unless I told her. </p> <p>Looking back on that day I was initially disappointed however in the end I realized that family is more important than being spoiled. If I could go back in time to when I said yes to my sister I would elaborate more. Specifically I would ask her if she was making sweet potato pie since that is my favorite dessert. At that time if she said no I could have offered to pick one up since I was  in the store. She would have also benefited from this because she would have less pie to make.  More importantly no pumpkins would go to waste since no one actually wanted to eat the pumpkin pie. </p><p>Overall the lesson learned from this experience is to be direct and express yourself clearly. No one will know what brings you pleasure if you don't communicate that to them. In the future I will practice this by thoughtfully expressing myself to the ebay of my abilities. One word answers will never convey the deeper thoughts that we want people to know about us. </p>"

      "content": "<p>Today we will look at how my writing has grown throughout the course so far. This week we have introduced a new writing process, in this journal we will compare and contrast the old and new processes of writing. By doing this we will be able to reflect on our writing in order to grow into better writers. Essentially we are becoming better decision makers so that we can clearly convey our thoughts. </p> <p>Previously my approach to writing has been very structured. Using the same formula for my writings has given me consistent results. Initially I think of a concept for the writing journal then begin to put together a rough draft. In this draft I would get all of my thoughts out and include as much detail as possible. Afterwards I go through it and see if I missed any details. Checking to make sure all of my points are clearly addressed within the writing. Finally I make sure the writing flows well and there's no errors throughout the text. At this point the writing is complete and ready to be turned in. By following these steps I have been able to ensure that I produce good quality writing. </p>        <p>At first glance we can see that our new writing process has five components. This is even more detailed than my original process which I thought was very well structured. However upon looking deeper we can see that there are very similar concepts. When I write these five stages, invention, planning, drafting, revising and editing tend to blur more often than not. While I’m inventing I am also planning since it is hard to invent a piece of writing without carefully planning when to introduce each idea. However after that the process is pretty much the same as the process I have been using. </p> <p>Looking deeply into how I have been writing in the past I can see that my process was rushed. I can spend a lot more time earlier in the process so that the final product comes out even better. When I’m brainstorming there’s no need to immediately start drafting. Instead I can use this time to pull out more ideas so the writing can have more detail to paint a better picture for the audience which is a part of the planning stage. This makes me think of the Mark Twain quote, “Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words.” </p> <p>Now that we have analyzed our writing and compared it to the new writing process we can develop better writing skills. My brainstorming process will be more effective leading to a substantially better quality of writing to start the planning process with. In return the audience will get to enjoy an entirely different experience when reading my writing journals.</p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we are supposed to reflect on how the new writing process makes us anxious or nervous. However I’m of the mind that structure is better than chaos so I’m very excited to use the new writing process to the best of my ability. Instead of looking at all of the ways the writing process could give us anxiety I will highlight the ways this process will actually relieve anxiety, for me at least. I believe that my peers will have similar revelations once they get over the burden of more work.</p> <p>My major problem with the new writing process would absolutely be that it is much more time intensive. Previously when writing I could blend a lot of these steps into one fluid process. However this new writing process is much more rigid in structure.Breaking down the writing process into a more detailed form will force us to gather even more details, examples and explanations when we are writing our papers. I’m concerned that this search for more evidence to support our points will lead to unnecessary clutter within our writings. After all, when a point is made how much more should you continue to reinforce what you are proving? </p> <p>Although I despise the additional workload I do believe it will yield a better final revision of our writing. I’m very excited to try writing like this because I have always felt there is something missing from my writing. Hopefully breaking my process down even more will help me identify where I could spend more time perfecting my craft. Being introduced to this writing process is a tremendous opportunity for us since we will be able to grow as writers with the new found structure around our writing.</p> <p>I could see myself not using this detailed process in some cases where the overall writing is shorter, for instance Twitter. Even though they increased the character limit I do not think this process would shine there. This process is better at long form writing such as the Literary Narrative we have coming up shortly. I will definitely use this process on that project since it has such a high word  count. The new structure will make it much easier for me to reach that word count without feeling as if I’m grasping for straws when trying to reach the word count. </p>  <p>Overall I will feel a great sense of relief now that we have this writing process. Instead of viewing the process as a burden I see it more  as a helpful companion. Sure this process will require me to put much more hours into my writing but it is for my own benefit. So I am grateful for that. How else would we be able to achieve masterful writings in a short period of time? It comes down to structure. This new writing process will help me produce my best work yet!</p>"

      "content": "<p>In this jornal we will reflect on the looping activity we did in the previous participation exercise. Overall it was a great exercise in metacognition for me. I have never been so introspective as I was when practicing looping. I believe in the future this will help me be more creative by elaborating on ideas and making them into detailed explanations of my thoughts. ANother habit of mind that comes to mind when I think about looping is openness, there’s a degree of vulnerability when you dive deeper into your own thoughts. You start to realize why you have certain beliefs and can challenge yourself to resolve the errors in your own logic. </p><p>As stated previously, I loved doing the looping activity. For my literacy narrative I decided to write about my first  time writing a sales script. I still do not have this idea planned out to the point it would reach 1000 words, however the looping activity has helped me get much closer to that goal. During the looping event we were tasked with analyzing our chosen topic and thinking deeper about it. Pulling it apart,  dissecting it until we reach a deeper topic that we could expand upon even more. </p> <p>For me the primary insight that came from the looping activity was discipline. After reflecting on the experience that was writing my first sales script I came to the realization that it all came down to being disciplined. I would have never been able to complete the task if I didn't work at it diligently. Just lie any other accomplishment that is worthwhile, consistent focus and effort makes all the difference. Writing that sales script didn't just make me a better writer but it helped improve my character as a person. I was able to put my mind to something that I at first thought would be extremely difficult and accomplish it because I found the disciple to work at it. </p> <p>As an interventional tool the looping activity is amazingly insightful because you get to take an idea and then go deeper. This gives us the ability to add more details and experiences that support the point we are trying to make. The only way I could see this tool being unhelpful is if the original idea is weak to begin with. IF there’s no substance to the original idea it may be hard to look deeper into it because it's not factual. In my opinion this is actually helpful because it forces you to weed out bad ideas.</p> <p>So to conclude this writing I would say that the looping activity overall is a positive tool that all writers should use. I am very excited to use this in the literary narrative since it will not only help me reach the word count but it will also help me clarify the ideas that I have. When looping I will be able to see where these thoughts or ideas come from and be able to relate them to my audience. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will create the initial plan to complete the literacy narrative. We are doing this in hopes that it will make the actual assignment easier to write and give us a finely polished  essay. The literacy narrative is a highly complex piece of writing so planning will give us the extra material to work with by practicing our habits of mind creativity, persistence, flexibility and metacognition. I’m very interested to see the growth of my writing by utilizing planning. Producing a thorough rough draft will be a great first step in achieving this goal. </p>              <p>The primary insight of my literacy narrative is be discipline. In order to lead my audience to this primary insight I desire to discuss my first time writing a sales script. This writing will show that with discipline all things are possible. In the beginning I started off inexperienced since I have never written anything like that before. Through consistent effort I was able to break down this task step by step and build a successful script for myself. None of this would have been possible without discipline since there were many days where I felt I could not complete the assignment. </p> <p>The literacy narrative should also include subsections that show what discipline is and how I used the skills to complete the sales script. Structuring this properly will be of the utmost importance so that the reader is able to understand how much discipline played a role in completing the assignment. First I want to lay out the objectives for the sales script and why it was so important. I will expand on how much this script meant to me not only as a part of my job there but also the greater role this skill has in life. Then we will discuss how I actually broke this problem down in order to achieve it. There was so much research put into the assignment that you may not realize since the final script was so short. I will also include books and videos read prior to writing the sales script. I believe this made a big difference in the final outcome since the research helped produce great results. Lastly I plan on discussing the results that my disciple earned me. In my first month I was able to produce better results than my peers. This was due to solely my preparation and planning while producing the sales script. </p> <p>In conclusion the literacy narrative should be much easier now that we have these systems in place. Along with looping this effort in planning is going to make the writing process  more fluid. I’m sure that the readers will appreciate the amount of detail and effort put into the writing.</p>"

Through discipline I believe all things are possible. In this assignment I will attempt to prove that to you, the reader, by informing you on what discipline did for me during a time where I felt very uncertain of my writing. </p>      <p>A few years back during the spring I was accepted by a major communication company to be one of their direct sales representatives. Prior to this I had sales experience from being in a call center. In the call center we placed calls to businesses using a script that was provided for us. At the communication company it was completely different. Not only did they not provide a script for us, they didn’t even give us feedback once we each wrote our individual script. For me this was a big deal because I am always very critical of my own work. Now I have to produce my own high quality script in addition to that I had to go out and attempt to persuade people using it. Meaning that if my script was bad I wouldn’t make anywhere near the amount I was making at the call center. </p> <p>How could I accomplish this lofty goal? I had never written a script before in my life. At this point in my life the most important thing I had ever written would be my SAT essay. Of course the SAT essay was very important at the time, however once it’s done you can go on to the school of your choice and continue to improve yourself as a writer. The stakes were much different now, a bad script wouldn’t allow me the opportunity to improve even worse it would ultimately leave me unemployed. After the training sessions we would be sent into the field to produce sales using our newly crafted scripts. The goal for our first month was 8 sales, which seemed doable for me. Coming from the call center where the sales were much harder to finalize I was already capable of closing more than 2 deals per week. This told me that if I could make a decent script it would easy money in the bank. </p><img src='https://media2.giphy.com/media/sQBkCTTrJRLSE/200w.gif?cid=82a1493bsatsgla0w50m5y9vpiwnypeu9uyhmtq1gkxv25in&rid=200w.gif&ct=g' class='wa1-gif'/> <p>My task was clear,  I must make the best script I possibly could. So I started out with what I knew, The Straight Line pitch. As tragic as the movie wolf of wall street was I still consider Jordan Belfort a decent salesman. His technique does work however I believe most popular techniques work, not because the creator is amazing but because it gives you a structure to follow. Similar to a recipe to produce delicious food, following a sales formula will also help you produce amazing results. This is due to the fact that once you have a system you can repeat that system and tweak it to your taste or desired results.</p> <p>Although I had a system in place to help me it took discipline to be able to tailor the script to my specific situation. I wasn’t selling financial services any more which is what Jordan also sold. This time I was selling telecommunication services, this type of  service comes with a different set of expectations, objections, and responsibilities. With this in mind writing the script seemed daunting at first but I was able to work my way through it. Similar to this assignment I went through a rigorous process of writing, talking to myself to see if it was effective, deleting worlds that weren't necessary and then writing some more. This process overall may have taken me a full work week, unfortunately it was done off the clock on our personal time. Every day for two weeks I would go to training during the day and then work on my script afterwards. </p><iframe type='text/html' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups' width='336' height='550' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen style='max-width:100%; display:block; margin:auto' src='https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B01MG7ETBM&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_WDFCWFWR7A89VZNWDSYQ'  ></iframe> <p>While writing I had to remember that I was not writing this script for myself. This was for an audience, specifically homeowners many of whom already had these services from our competitor. In order to write a script for this audience I had to put myself in their shoes. What do they want from their service? How might their current provider be disappointing them? Most importantly  of all, why should they go through the hassle of switching providers? By the end of it I was amazed with my personal growth because I was finally putting the needs of others before my own. This process made me slightly less self-serving and genuinely invested in being able to connect with our potential customers. </p> <p>Once the script was finished it was time for trial by fire. We presented our scripts once to our fellow co-workers, it was at this point that we started losing people. Some weren’t able to complete their scripts and decided to completely move on from the company. Although I thought my script was mediocre I was determined to see what I could produce in the field. That month I finished with 16 sales! Twice as many as required by the company and more than most of my classmates. This was an amazing experience that made me much more confident in my writing abilities. Through discipline and dedication to producing quality work I was able to craft my own script to produce results that exceeded expectations. </p> <p>All things considered, writing the script turned out to be easier than I had initially thought. It took a lot of hours of consistent effort but in the end I had produced a high quality piece of work that would continue to pay itself back over time. To me this is another example of , “do the hard work even when you don't feel like it” . You may not feel up to the challenge but with consistent effort you can do anything you put your mind to.</p>"

The end result for the assignment should be one of my best writing pieces yet due to the amount of effort and planning put into it. Creating this plan for the revision will ensure that the final work is just as amazing as we intend it to be. We will also consider deadlines and time constraints throughout the week.</p>      <p>The peer review and reflection was a new experience for me. I had never written a piece of writing and had it reviewed by my peers before. The only thing similar would be receiving critiques in photography class. I appreciate the insight of my peers although they did not give me much to go on. I believe this happened because I did a very thorough job when making my first draft. My vision for the piece was clear and I was able to plan it accordingly. Due to this my peers were not able to give me much feedback. However the work is not complete I will attempt to improve the way I convey how significant this was in my journey as a writer. </p> <p>Since the original draft was very well thought out I will be able to make my revisions without spending too much time on them. This makes me very happy because it shows that my hard work has paid off. In order to show that this event was significant in my life I will need to revise sections to convey more emotion. It will take some time for me to dig deeper into myself to find the words that will help my audience understand that this was a very pivotal moment in my writing journey.</p> <p>In order to revise my writing assignment I will take the following steps. First I will reread the writing to see where my writing could be improved with more detail. It is important that my audience understand that this was the most important event in my writing journey so far. Secondly once I find these points I will attempt to convey more emotion within them. Although it is important for me to convey the significance of the script I may struggle to actually find the words that will help me accomplish this task. </p> <p>In conclusion now that we have a revision plan the work needed to be done is much clearer. I am thankful for this moment of clarity because it will not only help me produce a better final project, it will also help me become a better writer overall. Utilizing the habits of mind taught in this course such as persistence I will be able to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of me.</p>"

      "content": "<p>In this writers journal we will differentiate space from place. This can illuminate some ideas of how things change around us. This journal will detail spatial characteristics of space, a space’s place and how the place constructs its users. These are important details as we move forward in the course as well as life in general. Keeping these factors in mind we will be able to determine who a space has been designed for along with who will be excluded by these choices. </p> <p>Space is usually referred to in terms of outer space. For now we will focus on a space closer to us. My neighbor had a nice yard just across the street from me. In the warmer months he would have fruits, vegetables and visitors would come for barbeques. The smell of his spices were foreign to me as he was from Guyana and brought his culture with him to be shared with the neighborhood. It was a very nice space, well it still is because physically the space has not changed. It is still the same fifteen foot by twenty foot lot that it has always been.</p> <p>However this place has changed drastically. No longer is it the peaceful loving home of a family. My neighbor moved away and the new owners have turned his yard into a parking lot. The space is small so luckily there isn’t that much parking but still this has changed the functionality of the space making it feel like a different place. The purpose of this place has undergone a transformation under new ownership. Since they deem it a rental property I guess it makes sense that the small yard could be used to bring in more income.</p> <p>Nevertheless I think this is a terrible idea. This space should not be used in that way. The major transportation spots have parking lots closer to them. This would be an inconvenience for the people that live on the street since this will bring additional commercial traffic. Not only will there be a bigger burden on the main road but the residents of the home will not be able to use the outdoor space recreationally. The parking lot will have to function most days of the year leaving little time for the fun activities we had before. Since this is a single family home there should be more regulations about what kinds of businesses can operate in this area.</p> <p>To sum this all up there difference between space and place should now be apparent. Space is the physical dimensions of the area being described. While the term place is more related to the functions done in the area. Two places can occupy the same amount of physical space but be very different in use. Unfortunately I found that my old neighbors yard would be the perfect way to show in detail the difference between space and place. Now that we have this understanding we will be able to see these complexities throughout our daily life. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will discuss an element of a social media site. Specifically we will take a look at the main feed for linkedin. While examining this element we will take a deep dive into how exactly this feed works. Additionally we will find out how our communication is shaped by their service. This thought exercise will help us realize some of the possibilities of using this social media application to help communicate with others. </p> <p>Let’s start with what exactly is linkedin anyway? Linkedin is a specialty type of social networking site. Unlike Facebook or Instagram the purpose of Linkedin isn’t to just socialize with old friends or family. Linkedin is more used for professional networking and career development. On Linkedin you can do things to advance your career like connect with recruiters or even post your resume to be seen by potential employers.  By adding relevant information about your professional background linkedin then decides which recruiters or employers would be most interested in further communication with you. </p> <p>After the initial setting up of your profile it is now time to start posting content. You do this by interacting with the post element. Unlike twitter, linkedin gives you much more characters to express yourself. Instead of limiting you to only 280 characters, linkedin gives you a whopping 3,000 characters to impress recruiters and potential employers. This fact shows you that linkedin is more interested in allowing you to clearly communicate with your audience because they allow you to write more within a single post. Another notable feature of linkedin is that when you post you have the option of enriching your posts with multimedia. You can add things such as photos, documents, polls, events, videos and even the feature to create a celebration for receiving a desired employment opportunity. </p> <p>Capitalizing on these features gives us a huge advantage when it comes to our own personal branding as well as job seeking. Since we are allowed to share so much, potential employers can get a better idea of who we are and what we can bring to their organization. While posting is usually done on your main profile page it can also be done within groups. In these groups you can connect with other people who have similar interests to you. For instance I’m a part of a WordPress development group. In that group I can post things like what I’m currently working on or I can help others with issues they may be having. This is a great tool because it gives me the opportunity to share my expertise with other people who may not be in my immediate network. </p> <p>As you can see the posting element on linkedin is a very powerful tool. Utilizing this feature we can communicate with people all across the world. What an amazing opportunity for all of us, employers and potential employees can now get much more detailed information about each other before the first interview. I believe this will greatly benefit us in our future careers.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Today we are here to evaluate the outcome of our Talk-to process. We used this tool in order to take a step back from our second writing project, this way we can get a different perspective on what we have written so far as well as what more needs to be written. The talk-to process is great for situations where you can not have someone else review your writing before publishing because it allows you to gain additional insight. This new insight can then help create a more thorough writing piece that the audience can appreciate.</p> <p>The first requirement of the talk-to process is to, “imagine that your context analysis is the best thing you have ever read, and describe why this is the case”. To me this was a very powerful thought process. It urged me to highlight everything that was good about my writing. It showed places where I had put a lot of effort into the writing piece. These are areas where I think the audience will be able to connect with the writing, maybe even find it intriguing. This step in the process also shows me that effort was put into crafting the writing project in a way that fulfills all requirements. Secondly we were required to, “imagine that your context analysis is really quite terrible and describe why”. This step was even more thought provoking than the first. Instead of trying to find everything that was good in the project I had to deliberately look for everything that was wrong or flawed. When looking at a project with such a critical eye a lot of things can become very apparent that at first glance seem to be fine. </p> <p>Now that we have created this critical distance we can see changes that should be made to the writing project. The overall structure of the project is great however it could be improved. These improvements will be made by adding more examples to the writing project so that the audience can have a clearer understanding of the context. In order to add more detail to the project we will go back and look for historical information that further highlights the way our communication is shaped on the platform. This will allow the audience to have a better understanding of how these small, seemingly insignificant interfaces can have a big impact on the context of our communication.</p> <p>Overall I am very pleased with the outcome of this talk-to session. It has highlighted a great amount of information that is important to the audience. In order for the context to be made clear to the audience we must include these additional details. This will paint a clearer picture for the audience meaning the overall message of the writing project is able to be understood.</p>"

      "content": "<p>In this writing project we will examine the concept of  context analysis. While discussing context it is important that we elaborate on ideas that might not be clear to the audience upon first reading. It is important to note that different kinds of technology affect the context of the conversation. Specifically we will discuss Twitter, the modern real time social media communication application. By taking a deeper look into this service we will be able to identify how this technology shapes the context of the conversation we are having within it. </p> <p>Recently all the rave around twitter has been about the increase of the character limit. No longer are we stuck with the 140 character limit we now have 280 characters. In this age of social media we have to be careful with our words. Since twitter is so popular it is great that they are giving people ways to elaborate more within their posts. It’s also important to note why Twitter has these limits to begin with, after all I can write as much as I would like to here. When Twitter was created there was originally a 140 character limit. This is because Twitter was founded as a text messaging service. There is a limit from the telephone service providers on the limit of characters that you are allowed to send. The corporate stance from Twitter on this is that the new character limit is “still short and brief, but enabling more expression”.</p> <p>They certainly do have a point about us having more ways to express ourselves now in modern times. However it has not been just the character limit alone that has been improved. A major feature that has been added is the alternate text for images. These are a major part of the context of the conversation that happens on Twitter. Someone may post an image but as you know, a picture can say a thousand words. There must have been someone in the know at Twitter because you can now add a thousand words in the images alternative text feature. This is even more helpful for people with disabilities who may not have the ability to view the image. They now have more context in the alternative text area to find out more about the image that was posted.</p>   <p>Now there will be even more people to join our favorite watch parties. Users of Twitter all over the globe are able to join a real time conversation by just following a hashtag! In these times we are still dealing with the effects of the coronavirus, a lot of people are using services like Twitter to connect with others. This is great with watch parties because you and a lot of other people are enjoying the same stream of entertainment. This real time communication is great to get candid responses from our favorite celebrities. They are a huge part of the conversation because some people look to them as thought leaders. Their use of their messages can have big effects on all of us because they can dictate global markets for better or worse. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this writers journal we will discuss the complexities of audience. Audience addressed is the person you are writing for. In this situation it may be the professsor or other classmates who may come across this blog and decide to read it. These are the people you are actually writing for. On the other hand the audience invoked are the people you believe will be reading your blog. Which sounds like it could be the same people yet there is a chance that it could not be. In this journal we will discuss a instance where the was shifted. </p> <p>When I was a child I loved to write short fictional stories. These stories were written mostly for my self. The joy of being creative is very exciting to me. At the time of writing the audience addressed was  myself and other kids like me that were my classmates. My stories were mostly rooted in fantasy with my love of dragons, phoenix and griffins. A lot of my influence was from Greek mythology and other fantasy worlds such as Merlin. Luckily for me my stories started to gain a different audience. </p> <p>My teacher thought the stories were so well written that she posted them on display in the hallway. My audience addressed has no changed from just my classmates and teacher to all of the people who travel throughout the school building. Other students some older and some younger were now seeing my work. Not only schoolmates but also other staff within the building to the point even the lunch ladies were complimenting my writing. On parent teacher conference night my story was still on display in the hallway. This opened up another layer of audience that was not my originally invoked audience. The new addressed audience now even includes the parents of my schoolmates. </p> <p>Had I known my story would have such a drastically different audience addressed I think I would have written the stories differently. The humor used among children would be different compared to the humor for adults. However since I was a child myself I do not think I would have been ready for that challenge. Even though my audience addressed changed the audience was still receptive to the story because they  knew it was written by a child. </p>      <p>Another example of this would be books written for children such as Harry Potter. This book was written for teens but it took another life of it’s own once it was popularized. I read the first Harry Potter book when I was in junior high school. However just a few years later there were movies that brought in a huge audience. This new audience wasn’t just kids any more now all generations have been exposed to the story. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this writers journal we will discuss how context creates and constrains the amount of possibilities when addressing and invoking audiences. This is important because we want to understand how to communicate effectively with others. Specifically we will discuss the messaging feature of UpWork which is where I do a lot of my professional communication. The context of this being a online messaging service makes it so that the audience invoked is usually a private party.</p>      <p>The private party  or audience invoked is usually the specific client although some clients may be working in teams. Either way you know the invoked audience is here for a specific reason, they have a singular goal in mind. The goal is working on the project at hand and communicating about future additions to the project. This is very different from what we discussed in the last journal because in this context the written communication will not grow to a larger audience. There is almost no chance that the communication written on UpWork will later on become a published novel or movie. That makes  this context a lot more personal and private than writings that will be published for public reading. </p>      <p>The platform functions well as it is however I do see some changes that could be made to make the the platform better. One on one communication with the clients or freelancers is great however it would be nice if there was more moderation. Within the confines of the UpWork chat currently either party can say anything to each other. One thing that happens often is the change of deliverable while the project is already underway. Having a third party that can quickly dispute that would be a great addition. Currently if there is a dispute you have to go through a process that takes weeks and can negatively affect your relationship with the current client as well as future clients. </p>      <p>Another way the context could be changed would be to allow messaging among freelancers. Currently they have to be within your network and even then it isn’t guaranteed to work. I believe opening the messaging so that  any one can speak to any one would allow more transparency on the platform. The way it is now,  I would not be able to contact freelancers that have previously worked with a potential client. Being able to speak to them would give me foresight as to how to conduct my self with the client to ensure everything goes smoothly over the span of the project. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will discuss the ethical responsibilities that writers have to their readers. We have been learning about stakeholders, in this context stakeholders are the individuals or groups of individuals that will be affected by your writing. This is different from audience because the audience is the people that we are writing for, they are the ones that will read the written work. Stakeholders on the other hand may never read the written work however they will be affected by the decisions of the author and audience. For example when I write messages to my audience or clients on UpWork it is a private conversation. That conversation between my client and I will affect all people that view the product that we create, those people are the stakeholders in this context. </p> <p>In business we consider the big three ethical obligations to be laws, promises and principles. This can also apply to our writing. As writers we must make sure not to cross the lines of morality to ensure our audience doesn’t have a negative view of our work while also giving them something entertaining that  they will enjoy. A prime example of this is the “A song of fire and dance” series also known as Game of thrones. In this series there were multiple instances of murder and even rape. The author was very close to crossing the line and to some it was crossed. This caused outrage among some of the audience which lead to other stakeholders also wanting to protest parts of the book that they felt violated their values or principles. It is important to stay within the principles of society so that things like this do not happen.  We are responsible for giving the audience an entertaining story however we must be careful not to cross the lines of morality. </p> <p>As writers we should address these ethical obligations to stakeholders by determining in advance not only our target audience but also how that audience will in turn relate the writing to the stakeholders.  When we write we must be sure to think in advance about inclusion, respect and acknowledging people of our culture and the culture of others.  In reality writers could do things like exploring the world to experience the cultures that they will be writing about. Here in New York City we are privileged to be surrounded by cultures of all over the world. Queens it self is known as the  most diverse city in the world. Exploring throughout this city you would be able to experience and speak to people of all cultures before you write about them. By doing this we can foster a deeper level of appreciation for all people and be less likely to offend any group of people. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this writing project we will think about and analyze the complexities of audiences in rhetorical situations. Specifically we will take a look at the website for the computer manufacturer, Lenovo. Lenovo is a 37 year old company that was founded in Beijing, China. They produce a variety of products such as personal computers, smartphones, servers, supercomputers, peripherals, printers, televisions, scanners and storage devices. Lenovo’s slogan is “For those who do” meaning that their products will make you more productive in your personal and business life. From this we can assume their target audience is a younger person, someone who is looking to be as productive as possible.</p> <img src='https://www.lenovo.com/content/dam/lenovo/corporate/brand/stfa-3-0-2022/global/en/landing-page/water-cooled-full-width-article-blade-d.jpg' alt='snow day' style='width: 50%;  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'><p>From the main homepage we can tell that Lenovo is going for a younger audience because there is a picture of a child. In this picture the child is enjoying a snowstorm and blissfully eating the snow as it falls from the sky. This imagery makes us think that the products Lenovo is trying to sell us will invoke a child like joy that adults are always yearning for.  Obviously children can not buy products so this shows us that although they are appealing to a younger audience they are in a way excluding the older demographic. While looking around the site we can see that most of the images focus on young people of both genders. We do not see any pictures of older people until we start to look at the business products. Even then we see that the older man is demonstrating the product to a younger person. This shows the audience that the products will help their productivity. </p><p>When we think of the kairos of Lenovo’s website we can see that they are having a back to school sale. The month of August is when students begin to prepare to go back to school in America.  This sale further shows us that their audience is the younger generation. By offering deals at the time where people are going back to school they will be able to not only sell to those consumers now but also when they graduate. The majority of college aged students will be looking for things such as new phones or laptops capable of doing their schoolwork. While the younger professionals will mostly be focused on laptops that can help them with creative professions. Programs such as PhotoShop and Illustrator require a high level of hardware in order to run smoothly. Once they have the product and they are satisfied they will be more likely to buy from them again. This helps them lock in that generation of users to using their products. </p> <p>To conclude this audience analysis, we have demonstrated that Lenovo is gearing their marketing towards a younger audience. The audience invoked is in between early college students and young professionals. This has been shown through their text and images on the web site. I believe Lenovo’s marketing to this demographic has been a success although I have a bias since I am writing this on a Lenovo laptop, the sales of these products have been doing tremendously well. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will discuss how audience and context can aid us in the process of selecting relevant purposes in our writing situations. It is important to understand that purposes are rarely singular. When we are writing the context in relation to the purposes will help us determine which purposes to write about. We should keep an open eye to make sure that our purposes are selected in according to our audience in order to make our writing relatable to the audience that we are invoking. </p>      <p>When we consider the purposes of taking this course we must consider a lot of issues. English is the national language here in America so this course helps us with that foundational aspect of communication. In order to qualify for a job after college we will be required to be proficient in communication in the english language. Not only to get the job but also while we are on the job. We will have to communicate with other people so it is very helpful to have good English skills. This class helps us with that by getting us to practice and improve our communication skills through writing. By taking this course I am hoping to also improve my English skills. Although I am a native English speaker I still have room to grow. By consistently writing it has improved my communication skills tremendously to the point where I feel confident that I will be able to write more blogs and maybe even a book in the future. </p>      <p>All of these purposes can be grouped by the motivation to be successful. In my personal life communication skills are very important since you want to be able to communicate with friends. As you grow with your friends you will have a need to communicate the ideas that will help you both grow into the people you have envisioned. When considering my professional life communication is of the utmost importance. Unlike when you are speaking with friends your professional communication can have a different audience addressed. If you do not have great communication skills it may limit your growth within your company if someone doesn’t understand your vision. Conversely if you do have good communication skills you could be selected to move up even before you think you are ready because the people above you see that you are an asset to their team. </p>  <p>To conclude this journal we can see that my primary motivation to take this course is to become more successful in life. That is shown by the examples above specifically the instances where I mention how much my communication skills will help me inn all areas of life. I feel that this is very important not only for me but for everyone in the world. This assignment has taught me a lot about purpose, however I feel it is important to note that communication is so important that we even learn foreign languages so that we are able to communicate with those across the globe. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this writing assignment we will think about and analyze how purpose and strategies work in rhetorical situations. This project will explore how particular strategies work to support or achieve a purpose in a particular advertisement. Specifically we will discuss how Duolingo’s advertising on tiktok. The purpose of this project is to understand how strategies work to achieve a purpose, specifically how does this help them sell their product. Duolingo is a language learning mobile application on their platform you can learn many languages.  Personally I am not a tiktok user however I do use Duolinngo to supplement my learning of Spanish. </p>      <p>Since Tiktok by design is setup for users to be able to share short videos it is perfect for creating advertisements. The way Duolingo is doing their advertisements is very unique because they aren’t very pushy with their product. Instead they use pathos to make an emotional connection with the users, they do this by recreating trends which is what tiktok is all about. When something is trending everyone joins in to make their own renditions of the video that is trending. At surface level this does not seem like it will increase sales. There isn’t any way for them to directly charge customers on tiktok however it does increase brand awareness, so much so that they have amassed one million followers on tiktok alone. This in turn does increase sales because more people know of them and are sharing their short videos, which are actual advertisements, with more of their friends. </p> <video width='320' height='240' controls><source src='https://v16m-webapp.tiktokcdn-us.com/acad0855349686012b33c4092191aac3/62eb4c58/video/tos/useast5/tos-useast5-pve-0068-tx/ab74339696b54536b5f6e3da8443412f/?a=1988&ch=0&cr=0&dr=0&lr=tiktok_m&cd=0%7C0%7C1%7C0&cv=1&br=1336&bt=668&cs=0&ds=3&ft=ebtHKH-qMyq8ZHMzKwe2N9-qfl7Gb&mime_type=video_mp4&qs=0&rc=OzVoNDg4PDtkOTVoPGY6O0BpM2Q4Nmc6ZnUzZDMzZzczNEA0MzJjYGE2NmMxYy1iX2JhYSM0Z2szcjRvZ3FgLS1kMS9zcw%3D%3D&l=202208032234254C1B2B73D8B13D727E3E' type='video/mp4'>  Your browser does not support the video tag. </video>   <p>Duolingo also makes great use of ethos, by incorporating their mascot into all of the videos on tiktok. The strategy behind the mascot varies in each video which can also be tied to pathos. The ethos side of the mascot helps get the audience to feel familiar with the mascot because it is relatable. Depending on the trend that they are imitating the mascot can invoke different emotions which over times builds trust.  You begin to trust that the mascot for this brand is pushing you in a direction that will help you. The mascot has built an amazing track record by being so relatable and being involved in every day scenarios such as showing up in times square reminding you that it’s time to practice language learning. </p>      <p>We can tell that these advertisements have been successful by looking at the reported numbers from duolingo, since they are a public company they are required to publish their financial details quarterly. In the first quarter of 2022 they claim to have an increase in total bookings of 55% for a total of 102 million dollars. Their monthly active users also grew from the prior year by 23% for a total of 49 million people. Most importantly their total revenue has also increased by 47% for a total of 81 million dollars. This is very significant since this level of growth is incredibly hard to attain. </p>      <p>Unfortunately they do not use the logos strategies. I believe this is mostly due to the tiktok platform. The platform is very casual and informal so it would not be fitting to use such rigid data to try to convince people to use the service. Instead the perfect strategies are lighthearted and humorous. These are the type of videos that get shared with other people so they can continue to grow their brand awareness which in turn increases sales.</p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will take a look at how our reading and writing literates have evolved so far throughout this course. We have learned a lot about rhetorical read and writing, this has shaped how I will read and write well on into the future. This also ties into the story How to Read Like a Writer by Mike Bunn. Mr. Bunn explains much better than I could how our reading and writing comprehension has changed throughout this course as well as into the future. We will compare past experiences reading and writing to what we are capable of now thanks to the guidance and education of this course.</p><p>When I think of my writing in the past I can see that I am a much better writer now. This is because I have the tools to create much better work. In the past when I was writing it would be very hard for me to be creative. Even though I read many creative books within the fantasy genre. My thoughts were not exactly my own, I would do things such  as creating loose variations of other stories that I have read. Which is common among many writers however using tools like mind mapping I am a much more intentional writer.  Software tools such as notion can be a great asset in the modern day which further enhances our ability as writers. Since we no longer need to create everything with the standard pen and paper. This also allows us to collaborate much easier since these technological advances allow us to share our plans with people across the globe within seconds.</p>      <p>These changes have been very significant to my growth as a writer. Now that I have these tools at my disposal I am able to create much better writings. This will transfer into multiple areas of my life may it be personal or professional. My improvement in writing will be able to be a more efficient communicator when I write as well as when I speak. The way I think about reading has changed drastically because I now look for the purpose of the writing. I am more aware of authors that may have misleading messages within their text and thanks to this course I am more able to recognize these things. My word view has also changed because of this. I can now see the undertones within writing rhetoric where authors my say one thing but actually mean another thing. I feel much more confident as a reader and writer now that I have obtained these skills. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will discuss rhetorical analysis, this kind of analysis might help us enrich our reading, writing and thinking. This is what helps us become more effective and purposeful writers. In this journal we will take the opportunity to think about how analyzing what we are reading will help us discover different understandings of those rhetorical situations. Doing this will be a great way to practice our habits of mind curiosity, openness and meta-cognition. </p>      <p>First let us reflect on the communication through email. When I receive an email it is important to determine the purpose of this email. So many emails that I receive are just junk that makes its way to my inbox. Prior to reading what the email has in it’s body we see many things. We see the subject line of the email, this could give us a clue to the purpose of the email. However in practice the subject line is more likely to be something eye catching that the sender of the email thinks will cause us to open the email. This is not always the case and once it is done too much we will recognize the pattern. Especially if we see the same thing coming from the same person. The sender portion of the email is very telling since we can receive emails not only from the same individual but also the same company or domain. Receiving an email from bestbuy usually tells me it’s an ad. However I could also receive an email from the career department at bestbuy which I would respond to much differently. The ad may not get opened at all while the career center may interest me. </p>      <p>As stated above these other elements of the communication are able to tell me more about the contents of the email. When I see the rhetorical strategy I can then consider the purpose of the email. Another situation is when companies try to send emails that introduce their new content whether it be blogs or newsletters. It is important to analyze the rhetorical strategy of this since they are also trying to send you down a path of consuming more of their content. If you do not understand the rhetorical strategy you may be mislead to think that the purpose of this is to help you. However some of these people that you may receive emails from are not as helpful as others. Most of them are only interested in their own self interest so being aware of rhetorical strategies can help you discover that the purpose of the email is actually not to be helpful to you. This frees us from going down the wrong path and opens us open to finding better information to help us in our journey through life. </p>"

      "content": "<p>In this journal we will discuss some of the points we will be building on in the next writing project. We will be doing this in order to make sure we have a good website of choice for the project. This is an important part of planning for the project so that we have enough information to make a good judgment. I will be reviewing a few websites for this journal including Queens College, they are a university in my hometown of Queens, New York. Another web site we will look at is the Queens  Community House they are a community based charity in my hometown. Lastly we will look at the Major Taylor iron Riders web site they  are a black cyclist club.</p>      <p>Queens College is an important institution because of how they market themselves as one of the colleges where you get a great value for your money. This is a great example of the ethos strategy since  they use personal branding and cite credible sources. On their homepage you will see links to US News,  one of the most touted college review websites. This gives them credibility as they also give them the title of one of the most value for your money colleges. </p>      <p>Queens Community House is a charity that claims to provide individuals and families with the tools to enrich their lives and build healthy, inclusive communities. Their strategy doesn’t include any links to major sites that make their site more credible. From what we see on their site the strategy falls more in line with pathos. From the pictures of children we can tell that they are attempting to appeal to our emotions. They tell us that they would like to help the community so we should give them donations. They also use a lot of testimonials from people that they have helped in the past with their situations. My least favorite part of the site is another part of their pathos strategy where they have pop ups of the people who are supporting them. This is tied to pathos because it builds a personal connection as if we know the people who are supporting them.</p>      <p>Lastly we will look at the Major Taylor iron riders web site that represents the NYC faction of the national club. To me this was the hardest strategy to actually analyze. They do not do a very good job at   pushing any strategy to get people to sign up. If I had to choose a strategy that they fell in line with the most it would be ethos. They do a great job of showing pictures of the members from the club out having a good time. This also can be pathos since people will get an emotional connection from seeing people do what they also want to be doing. Overall Queens College has done the best job at proving their purpose. </p>"
